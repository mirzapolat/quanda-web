# Quanda Web App

With Quanda, you can display as many random cards with questions as you likeâ€”perfect for getting to know each other better. The special feature: No one dictates how your question decks should look. You can design them entirely according to your preferences and easily import them into Quanda, share them with friends, or publish them. This way, everyone benefits from Quanda, and as a browser app, it can be used anywhere. Quanda can also be installed as a PWA app.
