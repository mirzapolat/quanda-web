# Quanda Web App

Quanda is a versatile web application that lets you create and display randomized question cards - making it the perfect tool for icebreakers, team building, or social gatherings. What sets Quanda apart is its flexibility: you have complete freedom to create custom question decks tailored to your needs. Simply design your questions, import them via CSV files, and start engaging conversations.

Share your carefully crafted question decks with friends or publish them to the community. As a modern browser-based application, Quanda is accessible from any device with a web browser. For an enhanced mobile experience, you can install Quanda as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and use it offline.
